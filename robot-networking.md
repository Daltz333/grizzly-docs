## Robot Networking
FRC Robots can be networked various ways. The most common way is through the usage of what's called [DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol). In simple terms, DCHP auto assigns IP addresses to devices connected to the DHCP server.
